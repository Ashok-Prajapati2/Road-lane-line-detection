# Lane Detection Project Development Guidelines

## Introduction
This document provides guidelines for the development of the lane detection project. It includes information on project structure, coding conventions, version control, and documentation.

## Project Structure
The project follows a structured organization to maintain clarity and facilitate collaboration among team members. The main directories and their purposes are as follows:

- `app/`: Contains the application entry point and main script for running lane detection.
- `lane_detection/`: Contains modules for lane detection algorithms and related functionalities.
- `data/`: Stores data files such as test images, test videos, and camera calibration data.
- `models/`: Contains machine learning models, such as CNN models for lane detection.
- `results/`: Stores output results, including processed images, videos, and log files.
- `docs/`: Contains project documentation, including README.md and development.md.
- `lib/`: Contains external libraries and dependencies.
- `scripts/`: Stores utility scripts, such as setup.py and run_tests.py.
- `tests/`: Contains automated unit and integration tests for the project.
- `config/`: Stores configuration files, such as environment.yml and parameters.json.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and prototyping.

## Coding Conventions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance readability.
- Write docstrings for classes, functions, and modules to provide documentation.
- Use type hints for function arguments and return values where appropriate.
- Avoid hardcoding constants; use configuration files or constants defined at the top of the file.

## Version Control
- Use Git for version control.
- Create meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.
- Use branches for feature development and merge requests for code review.
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable at all times.

## Documentation
- Maintain thorough documentation for the project, including README.md and development.md files.
- Describe project setup instructions, usage examples, and dependencies in the README.md.
- Document development guidelines, coding conventions, and project structure in development.md.
- Update documentation regularly to reflect changes and improvements in the project.

## Continuous Integration
- Implement continuous integration (CI) to automate testing and deployment processes.
- Use CI tools such as Travis CI or GitHub Actions to run tests and checks on each commit.
- Configure CI pipelines to enforce coding standards, run automated tests, and deploy to production.

## Collaboration
- Foster collaboration and communication among team members.
- Use project management tools like Trello or Asana to track tasks and progress.
- Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and share knowledge among team members.
- Encourage open communication and constructive feedback within the team.

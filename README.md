# Lane Detection Project

This project implements a lane detection system using computer vision techniques and deep learning.

## Introduction

Lane detection is a crucial component of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. This project aims to develop a robust lane detection algorithm capable of accurately identifying lane boundaries in images and videos captured by a vehicle's onboard camera.

## Features

- Detects lane boundaries in images and videos.
- Supports real-time lane detection.
- Provides visualization of detected lanes overlaid on input images/videos.
- Supports both straight and curved lane detection.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lane-detection-project.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd lane-detection-project
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app/main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Place input images or videos in the `data/test_images/` or `data/test_videos/` directory.
2. Run the application using the provided instructions.
3. View the output results in the `results/` directory.

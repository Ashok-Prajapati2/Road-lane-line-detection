## Introduction

Lane detection is a crucial component of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. This project aims to develop a robust lane detection algorithm capable of accurately identifying lane boundaries in images and videos captured by a vehicle's onboard camera.

## Features

- Detects lane boundaries in images and videos.
- Supports real-time lane detection.
- Provides visualization of detected lanes overlaid on input images/videos.
- Supports both straight and curved lane detection.
- Uses deep learning models for enhanced accuracy.
- Logs training and evaluation metrics for model performance analysis.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ashok-Prajapati2/Road-lane-line-detection.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd Road-lane-line-detection
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app/main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Place input images or videos in the `data/test_images/` or `data/test_videos/` directory.
2. Run the application using the provided instructions.
3. View the output results in the `results/` directory.



## Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory:

- `environment.yml`: Specifies the conda environment setup.
- `parameters.json`: Contains configurable parameters for the lane detection algorithm.
